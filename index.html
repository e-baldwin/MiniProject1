                            This visualization was created by the Pew Research Center. It displays the percent of the US population by age group from 1950-2060.
                            The sides are split between males and females and the darkest shaded lines are the baby boomer generation. 
                            The axis' are labeled with the ages (y-axis) and the percentages (x-axis). This displays how population demographics has shifted since the 1950s.
                            Medical Intervention and healthcare have kept people alive longer. As time progresses, this pyramid turns into a rectangle. 

                            <ul>
                                <li>Truthful - This data is from a reputable source. A reputable source also created the display.</li>
                                <li>Functional - It is animated and effectively communicates the data to the reader.</li>
                                <li>Beautiful - This has nice colors and style. </li>
                                <li>Insightful - This data provides insight on how the populations have changed in age from the 1950s-2060.</li>
                                <li>Enlightening - This visualization allows the reader to understand how medical intervention/health care as well as decreasing birth rates 
                                    are reflected in the ages in the population.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            This is a good visualization because it displays accurate information clearly. It is able to meet the criteria of all 5 principles. It is an animated design that allows the reader 
                            to see the ages of the population throughout the years. It also allows the reader to see the split based on gender.
                            The reader is also able to learn more from this diagram, like the importance of medical intervention in keeping generations alive.

                        <p>
                            This visualization was created by Hazel Healy, Christina Hicks, and David McCandless.
                            It shows the global food supply and consumption in 2020 for the categories of: red meat; poultry, fish, eggs; milk and dairy; pulses, legumes, nuts; whole grains; fruits and vegetables; and starchy vegetables. 
                            The categories are listed at the top, in boxes corresponding to the amount of supply in that category.
                            From there, the corresponding amount within the category is sent to its corresponding geographical location in a well-designed Sankey diagram.
                            Then it moves to consumption, using a visual representation of marks to show the average amount of food consumed per person per year within each geographical location.
                            After that, there is a heatmap comparing the percentages of different food groups being over- or under- consumed in each location. 
                            The table uses the color channel to emphasize the larger percentages.
                            At the very bottom is a modified bar chart, which compares the total human need with the total production.
                            This visualization summarizes the data in a way that allows readers to compare values and identify trends, correlation, and part-to-whole relationships. 
                            It allows people to see the imbalances of food supply and consumption to different parts of the world.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Truthful - The data is taken from reputable sources (e.g. the food and agriculture organization of the united nations) and presented in a way that does not show bias. </li>
                            <li>Functional - It effectively communicates the data by using various marks and channels for different parts of the visualization, which allows readers to understand the message fairly easily. </li>
                            <li>Beautiful - It is visually appealing. It provides a lot of data, but doesn’t look cluttered.</li>
                            <li>Insightful - It provides insight on global food supply/consumption. </li>
                            <li>Enlightening - It allows the reader to understand the difference in consumption between continents and how much certain populations over or under consume. Additionally, it forces the reader to think about the contrast between how much we consume and how much we actually need for consumption. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            This visualization is good because it communicates the data effectively and concisely. It follows the 5 principles of visualization properly as well and provides food for thought in its message.

                        <p>
                            The audience of this visualization are readers of The Wall Street Journal, most likely in particular sports or football fans.
                            The message that this visualization conveys is the intensity of the sport resulting in many injuries throughout the course of the NFL season.
                            The data that is encoded in this visualization is the cumulative amount of injuries sustained by NFL athletes and the corresponding body group affected.
                            The visualization encodes the data using varying sizes of circles corresponding to the frequency of injuries sustained. These data circles also have values, and this mark is positioned along various sections of an image of a football player’s body to indicate the respective injury. 
                            Additionally, some body group injuries are broken down into smaller subsections detailing the type of injury.
                            Readers can identify extremes and see that although the majority of injuries sustained are in the lower body, it is also worrisome to see that a vast proportion of head injuries suffered have been concussions.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Truthful - the data is collected throughout the NFL season</li>
                            <li>Functional - effectively communicates the data</li>
                            <li>Beautiful - the visualization uses the full range of the image of a football player’s body in motion</li>
                            <li>Insightful - provides an insight on the breakdown of NFL injuries</li>
                            <li>Enlightening - Provides concerning information for the reader</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As a result, this visualization is effective because it conveys data in a way that makes readers aware of the repercussions 
                            the NFL season has on the bodies of athletes.</p>

                            This visualization was created by an agency called Blueberry Labs. It displays the most common colors used by brands.
                            The audience of this graphic is anyone interested in marketing or brand management and anyone interested in graphics that brands use.
                            The message is displayed in a color coded bubble chart. The audience can compare the percentage numbers as well as the colors. 
                            The five visualization principles:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Truthful -  This data is most likely accurate.</li>
                                    <li>Functional -  The circles are placed without reason. The sizes of the circles do not make sense.</li>
                                    <li>Beautiful - The colors in this design are very nice, but they overlap for no reason. </li>
                                    <li>Insightful -  Not Insightful. It does not mention why any of this is important.</li>
                                    <li>Enlightening -  This does not convey any larger message or information.</li>
                                </ul>
                            This visualization does not fulfill the 5 principles. It is also bad because the size of the bubbles is not dependent on the size of the percentage. 
                            This confuses the reader because larger bubbles are actually smaller percentages which makes the graphic difficult to understand.

                        <p>

                                <li>The first redesign is a bar chart. This chart has the colors on the x axis and percentages on the y-axis. This allows the reader to compare the percentages more easily.
                                    The bars would be shaded in the color that it is labeled as well. </li>
                                <li>The second redesign is a stacked bar chart. This bar chart would have the company names on the x axis and the percentage of colors used on the y-axis. 
                                This chart would be stacked as 95% of companies use 1 or 2 colors, so it would allow for mulitple colors to be seen on the same graph for the same company. 
                                The bars would be shaded in with the described color for the reader to have a better visual understanding.
                                A stacked bar chart also allows us to remove columns for using 1-2 or more than two colors as this information would be displayed in each stack.
                                    </li>
                                <li>The third redesign is a more accurate bubble chart. The x-axis of this bubble chart has the percentages of the colors used. The bubble size would correspond to the percentage size.
                                This would allow the reader to understand the data better. The bubbles would also be shaded in with the corresponding color for easier understanding. 
                                I think this third design would be the best redesign as it is interesting and fun to look at while also accurately displaying the data.

                            This visualization is from the USDA, Economic Research Service. 
                            It is intended to inform people that are on a diet about how they should allot their calories intake to maximize enjoyment. 
                            It uses a bar chart with the calorie diet as the x-axis and the number of calories for indulgent foods as the y-axis. 
                            This allows readers to compare values and attempts to let them identify part-to-whole relationships with the percentages. 
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Truthful - The data is from the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, prepared by the USDA. </li>
                            <li>Functional - It is confusing because the bars are labeled with percentages (in which the calories for other uses are divided by the total calories in the diet). This is why the 9% bar appears to be larger than the 15% bar; however the math is correct, since 162 calories is indeed larger than 150 calories. </li>
                            <li>Beautiful - The design is good, but not particularly outstanding. </li>
                            <li>Insightful - It is an infographic, so the information is useful provides a learning opportunity. </li>

                            <li>The second redesign is a line graph. This allows you to visualize the data points and compare them with each other. If someone was trying to decide on a diet based on the indulgent calorie ratio, this would make it more clear. </li>
                            <li>
                                The third redesign is a stacked bar chart. It is very similar to the first redesign, except the full bar is the total calorie intake with the bottom part for the number of calories for indulgent foods and the top part for the number of calories for healthy foods. 
                                I think this would be the best redesign, as it would properly show both the correlation between the total calorie intake and the number of calories allotted for indulgent foods, as well as the part-to-whole relationship. It also combines the visually appealing and functional aspects the best.

                        <p>
                            The audience of this visualization are Alabama government officials and citizens perusing the website for labor statistics.
                            This visualization aims to show a relative comparison of unemployment insurance claims.
                            The data that is encoded in this visualization is the number of unemployment insurance claims per week.
                            The visualization encodes the data using circles, numbers, and colors.
                            Readers can see the amount of claims relative to other weeks.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Truthful - the data is collected throughout the Alabama Department of Labor season</li>
                            <li>Functional - hard to decipher because of the random circles scattered around</li>
                            <li>Beautiful - the colored circles are interesting, and there is interaction</li>
                            <li>Insightful - not really, because it merely presents statistics as opposed to indicating why</li>
                            <li>Enlightening - not really, because it doesn’t convey any information or message past the raw data values</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This visualization is bad because it does not fulfill the five principles. 
                            The data presented is not particularly useful because it is just number values, and the data is encoded using circles, which once again, only presents numbers.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>For redesign 1 I chose a line graph because this can accurately display any noticeable trends along a linear scale. Additionally the date being on the x-axis allows for a linear progression.</li>
                            <li>For redesign 2 I chose a bar graph because it can accurately compare the data values across weeks, while being categorized within the greater month label. The x-axis allows the data to be partitioned into months, which helps with a forward progression.</li>
                            <li>For redesign 3 I chose a stacked bar graph because it can compare the data within each month. The colors help to differentiate different weeks within a month, as opposed to the original visualization where the colors were simply corresponding with a random week. However, the stacked bar chart may have problems in that some months have a different amount of weeks.</li>
