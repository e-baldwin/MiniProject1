                            This visualization was created by the Pew Research Center. It displays the percent of the US population by age group from 1950-2060.
                            The sides are split between males and females and the darkest shaded lines are the baby boomer generation. 
                            The axis' are labeled with the ages (y-axis) and the percentages (x-axis). This displays how population demographics has shifted since the 1950s.
                            Medical Intervention and healthcare have kept people alive longer. As time progresses, this pyramid turns into a rectangle. 

                            <ul>
                                <li>Truthful - This data is from a reputable source. A reputable source also created the display.</li>
                                <li>Functional - It is animated and effectively communicates the data to the reader.</li>
                                <li>Beautiful - This has nice colors and style. </li>
                                <li>Insightful - This data provides insight on how the populations have changed in age from the 1950s-2060.</li>
                                <li>Enlightening - This visualization allows the reader to understand how medical intervention/health care as well as decreasing birth rates 
                                    are reflected in the ages in the population.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            This is a good visualization because it displays accurate information clearly. It is an animated design that allows the reader 
                            to see the ages of the population throughout the years. It also allows the reader to see the split based on gender.
                            The reader is also able to learn more from this diagram, like the importance of medical intervention in keeping generations alive.

                            The audience of this visualization are readers of The Wall Street Journal, most likely in particular sports or football fans.
                            The message that this visualization conveys is the intensity of the sport resulting in many injuries throughout the course of the NFL season.
                            The data that is encoded in this visualization is the cumulative amount of injuries sustained by NFL athletes and the corresponding body group affected.
                            The visualization encodes the data using varying sizes of circles corresponding to the frequency of injuries sustained. These data circles also have values, and this mark is positioned along various sections of an image of a football player’s body to indicate the respective injury. 
                            Additionally, some body group injuries are broken down into smaller subsections detailing the type of injury.
                            Readers can identify extremes and see that although the majority of injuries sustained are in the lower body, it is also worrisome to see that a vast proportion of head injuries suffered have been concussions.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Truthful - the data is collected throughout the NFL season</li>
                            <li>Functional - effectively communicates the data</li>
                            <li>Beautiful - the visualization uses the full range of the image of a football player’s body in motion</li>
                            <li>Insightful - provides an insight on the breakdown of NFL injuries</li>
                            <li>Enlightening - Provides concerning information for the reader</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As a result, this visualization is effective because it conveys data in a way that makes readers aware of the repercussions 
                            the NFL season has on the bodies of athletes.</p>

                            This visualization was created by an agency called Blueberry Labs. It displays the most common colors used by brands.
                            The audience of this graphic is anyone interested in marketing or brand management and anyone interested in graphics that brands use.
                            The message is displayed in a color coded bubble chart. The audience can compare the percentage numbers as well as the colors. 
                            The five visualization principles:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Truthful -  </li>
                                    <li>Functional -  The circles are placed without reason. The sizes of the circles do not make sense.</li>
                                    <li>Beautiful - The colors in this design are very nice, but they overlap for no reason. </li>
                                    <li>Insightful -  Not Insightful. It does not mention why any of this is important.</li>
                                    <li>Enlightening -  This does not convey any larger message or information.</li>
                                </ul>
                            This visualization is bad because the size of the bubbles is not dependent on the size of the percentage. 
                            This confuses the reader because larger bubbles are actually smaller percentages which makes the graphic difficult to understand.

                                <li>The first redesign is a bar chart. This chart has the colors on the x axis and percentages on the y-axis. This allows the reader to compare the percentages more easily.
                                    The bars would be shaded in the color that it is labeled as well. </li>
                                <li>The second redesign is a stacked bar chart. This bar chart would have the company names on the x axis and the percentage of colors used on the y-axis. 
                                This chart would be stacked as 95% of companies use 1 or 2 colors, so it would allow for mulitple colors to be seen on the same graph for the same company. 
                                The bars would be shaded in with the described color for the reader to have a better visual understanding.
                                A stacked bar chart also allows us to remove columns for using 1-2 or more than two colors as this information would be displayed in each stack.
                                    </li>
                                <li>The third redesign is a more accurate bubble chart. The x-axis of this bubble chart has the percentages of the colors used. The bubble size would correspond to the percentage size.
                                This would allow the reader to understand the data better. The bubbles would also be shaded in with the corresponding color for easier understanding.

                            The audience of this visualization are Alabama government officials and citizens perusing the website for labor statistics.
                            This visualization aims to show a relative comparison of unemployment insurance claims.
                            The data that is encoded in this visualization is the number of unemployment insurance claims per week.
                            The visualization encodes the data using circles, numbers, and colors.
                            Readers can see the amount of claims relative to other weeks.

                        <p>This visualization is bad because it does not fulfill the five principles. 
                            The data presented is not particularly useful because it is just number values, and the data is encoded using circles, which once again, only presents numbers.</p>

                            <li>For redesign 1 I chose a line graph because this can accurately display any noticeable trends along a linear scale. Additionally the date being on the x-axis allows for a linear progression.</li>
                            <li>For redesign 2 I chose a bar graph because it can accurately compare the data values across weeks, while being categorized within the greater month label. The x-axis allows the data to be partitioned into months, which helps with a forward progression.</li>
                            <li>For redesign 3 I chose a stacked bar graph because it can compare the data within each month. The colors help to differentiate different weeks within a month, as opposed to the original visualization where the colors were simply corresponding with a random week. However, the stacked bar chart may have problems in that some months have a different amount of weeks.</li>
